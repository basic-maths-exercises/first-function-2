# Modulo function

You can use all the Python that you have learned elsewhere within the functions that you define.  With this in mind try to see if you can use an if statement within a function block to define a function called `modulo` that returns the modulus of a real number.  Remember that to calculate the modulus of a number you multiply it by minus one if it is less than 0 and you multiply by one if it is greater than or equal to zero.
